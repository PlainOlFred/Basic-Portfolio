                    So, there’s really no notes from the first class. Bootcamp spot is where you will find the panopto videos. I suppose the take away notes could be the CMD commands already posted in this channel. I’ll repost, but once we get ya’ll in github that’s where all the valuable class information lives which we will slowly add to over the program.

                The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name is—that is fine and expected.
