                I have been employed as a Teacher Assitant for a high school credit revcovery program 
                for the pass year. I also held a part-time job at Target as a logicist team member for the
                pass to years. Both of these job intoduced me to two career paths: Eduaction and supply chain
                management. 
                This coding camp has intoduce me to a third.

                After graduating from Texas A&M in 2014, I began working as a data analyst for an MWBE law
                firm, working on disparity studies. In 2014, I depolyed to Afghanistan for 1 year. While 
                overseas I applied for addmission into a Ecomonics masters program, but was denied.

                Returning home from overseas, I began to work for the Austin school ditrict as a substitute,
                and eventually took a part-time job at Target to gain experience in supply chain management.
                After two years subbing, I took a full-time position as a Teacher Assistant.
